programming language :
     	
programming language means set of instructions interact with machine and human
 
 
three types of programming language :
1) low level programming language
     	low level language means machine understandable language. only machine can understand o's and 1's language(binary language)
     	low level language human cannot understand so thats we will introduced mid level language.
     	
 
2) mid level programming language
     	mid level is assembly level language.
     	we cannot developed large application using mid level language like amazon , flipkart.
     	mid level programming language human and machine cannot understand because its combination of high level and low level language.
     	thats y we introduce high level language.
 
3) high level  programming language
     	high level programming language means human understandable language. human can implement or write your own logic in program.
e.g, high level programming language c, cpp, python, java

Great question! Here's a clear comparison between OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming) paradigms:

ðŸ†š OOP vs POP Paradigm
Feature
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming)
Approach
Based on real-world objects
Based on procedures or functions
Structure
Organized around classes and objects
Organized around functions and procedures
Data Handling
Data and functions are bundled together in objects
Data is often global, and functions operate on it
Security
Provides data hiding using access modifiers (private, public)
No built-in mechanism for data hiding
Reusability
Supports inheritance, making code reusable
Code reuse is limited to function calls
Flexibility
More scalable and modular
Less flexible for large programs
Examples
Java, C++, Python (OOP style)
C, Pascal, BASIC
